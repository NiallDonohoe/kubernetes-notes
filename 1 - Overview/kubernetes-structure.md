Pods, Nodes, ReplicaSets,... kubernetes has lots of terms to define the different elements of architecture. Here are the basics, and a diagram of how they fit together.

- Images - This is the software that you actually want to deploy.
- Pods - This is the lowest level at which kubernetes operates. A pod contains a container with an image.
- ReplicaSets
