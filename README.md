# Kubernetes Notes

### This guide/reference is intended to give to useful commands/tricks to keep in mind when using kubernetes.
---
I am keeping these here mostly beacuse I forget them but also because they may be useful to others starting their kubernetes journey.


Probably the best resource for learning and using k8s is the [Kubernetes Documation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/). 

There are many other online tutorials/guides but in my opinion the official kubernetes documentation and the few useful commands outlined in this repo will hopefully set you up for success.

Much of this is a work in progress as I am am documenting these tips as I am learning. :)
